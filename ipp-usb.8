.SH "NAME"
\fBipp\-usb\fR \- Daemon for IPP over USB printer support
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBipp\-usb\fR daemon enables driver\-less printing and scanning on USB\-only AirPrint\-compatible printers and MFPs\.
.
.P
It works by connecting to the device by USB using IPP\-over\-USB protocol, and exposing the device to the network, including DNS\-SD (ZeroConf) advertising\.
.
.P
IPP printing, eSCL scanning and web console are fully supported\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.
.SS "Usage:"
\fBipp\-usb mode [options]\fR
.
.SS "Modes are:"
.
.TP
\fBstandalone\fR
run forever, automatically discover IPP\-over\-USB devices and serve them all
.
.TP
\fBudev\fR
like standalone, but exit when last IPP\-over\-USB device is disconnected
.
.TP
\fBdebug\fR
logs duplicated on console, \-bg option is ignored
.
.TP
\fBcheck\fR
check configuration and exit
.
.SS "Options are"
.
.TP
\fB\-bg\fR
run in background (ignored in debug mode)
.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
\fBipp\-usb\fR searched for its configuration file in two places: 1\. \fB/etc/ipp\-usb/ipp\-usb\.conf\fR 2\. \fBipp\-usb\.conf\fR in the directory where executable file is located
.
.P
Configuration file syntax is very similar to \.INI files syntax\. It consist of named sections, and each section contains a set of named variables\. Comments are started from # or ; characters and continues until end of line:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

# This is a comment
[section 1]
variable 1 = value 1  ; and another comment
variable 2 = value 2
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0

.SS "Network parameters"
Network parameters are all in the \fB[network]\fR section:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

[network]
  # TCP ports for HTTP will be automatically allocated in the following range
  http\-min\-port = 60000
  http\-max\-port = 65535

  # Enable or disable DNS\-SD advertisement
  dns\-sd = enable      # enable | disable

  # Network interface to use\. Set to `all` if you want to expose you
  # printer to the local network\. This way you can share your printer
  # with other computers in the network, as well as with iOS and Android
  # devices\.
  interface = loopback # all | loopback

  # Enable or disable IPv6
  ipv6 = enable        # enable | disable

.SS "Logging configuration"
Logging parameters are all in the \fB[logging]\fR section:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

[logging]
  # device\-log  \- what logs are generated per device
  # main\-log    \- what common logs are generated
  # console\-log \- what of generated logs goes to console
  #
  # parameter contains a comma\-separated list of
  # the following keywords:
  #   error     \- error messages
  #   info      \- informative messages
  #   debug     \- debug messages
  #   trace\-ipp, trace\-escl, trace\-http \- very detailed per\-protocol traces
  #   all       \- all logs
  #   trace\-all \- alias to all
  #
  # Note, trace\-* implies debug, debug implies info, info implies error
  device\-log    = all
  main\-log      = debug
  console\-log   = debug

  # Log rotation parameters:
  #   log\-file\-size    \- max log file before rotation\. Use suffix M
  #                      for megabytes or K for kilobytes
  #   log\-backup\-files \- how many backup files to preserve during rotation
  #
  max\-file\-size    = 256K
  max\-backup\-files = 5

  # Enable or disable ANSI colors on console
  console\-color = enable # enable | disable
